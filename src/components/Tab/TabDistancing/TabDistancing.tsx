    Since close person-to-person contact appears to be the main source of transmission,
    social distancing remains a key way to mitigate spread.
    Keep a distance of approximately 6 feet from others in public places.
    This distance will help you avoid direct contact with respiratory droplets produced by coughing or sneezing.
    In addition, studies have found that outdoor settings with enough space to distance and
    good ventilation will reduce risk of exposure.
